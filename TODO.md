# Still in Testing / Playing mode:

- Write a separate package for testing django models against a spec, proof of concept.
- Ditto for Wagtail Pages & Blocks

# Stability / initial Release (if concept proves reasonable)

- More tests (could we have a test-suite of <feature.md>/<feature.json> pairs?)
- A way to ignore unknown lines
- Better comments?
- Better logging & warnings, etc (including showing the line number)
- Handle tables, checkboxes, and other common markdown features
- Some options, loaded from pyproject.toml?

# After that:

- An initial implementation in JS or another language, using the same test suite?
